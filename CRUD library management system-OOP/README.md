<h2>Project Overview: Library Management System</h2>
<br>
<p>This Library Management System showcases the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, specifically inheritance and polymorphism. The system defines a base Item class, from which specific item types—Book, Magazine, and Newspaper—inherit. Each subclass overrides methods to provide specific behaviors, demonstrating polymorphism.</p>
<br>

<p>The application also implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to manage library items effectively. Users can add new items, edit existing ones, and delete items as needed.</p>
<br>

<p>Data persistence is achieved through local storage, ensuring that items remain available even after a page refresh. This combination of OOP principles, CRUD operations, and local storage creates a robust, responsive and maintainable system for managing library resources.</p>
