<p><h4>Project Introduction</h4>
This Task Manager application showcases the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through a structured design that emphasizes reusability and encapsulation.
<br>

<h4><b>Key OOP Concepts Used:</b></h4>

<b>Classes and Instances:</b> The Task class represents individual tasks, encapsulating properties like id, name, and type. The TaskManager class oversees a collection of tasks and handles user interactions.
<br>

<b>Encapsulation:</b> Private fields (e.g., #tasks and #storageKey) are employed to hide implementation details, ensuring that the task management logic remains protected from external access.
<br>

<b>Static Properties:</b> The static property storageKey allows easy access to the local storage key for task persistence without needing to instantiate the class.
<br>

<b>CRUD Functionality:</b> The application supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for tasks. Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones via a modal interface, and delete tasks as needed.
<br>

<b>Local Storage:</b> The use of the browser's local storage ensures that tasks persist even after a page refresh, allowing users to maintain their task list over time.
<br>

This project highlights a solid understanding of OOP principles and their practical application in JavaScript, resulting in a modern and functional task management tool.
